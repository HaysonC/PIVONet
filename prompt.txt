Existing code is in src/.


main is the entry point. CLI or GUI (cli/ or app/) is not needed for now.


CFD Package (cfd/) which should be kinda completed by now


Implement a cfd/ package for computational fluid dynamics.


This package should:


Handle mesh creation and fluidic simulation (via PyFR).


Export particle trajectory data.


Provide clear, modular, and hierarchical interfaces for CFD results.




Any default parameters should be loaded from config.yml via utils.py.


Utilities (utils/) should also handle cache and data management:


Root contains a data and cache file.


Each run should create a new cache subdirectory and manage cache there.


Include any helper functions needed by cfd/ in utils/.




Modeling & Hybrid Approach:


Implement features from the old code, primarily as references for innovation.


Particle trajectory modeling uses a hybrid approach:


Train a variational encoder at each point to model diffusion behavior.


Train a CNF (Continuous Normalizing Flow) model to model normal → end distributions and trajectories.




Model results should have modular interfaces integrated with CFD results.


Visualization & Animation:


Implement robust visualization and animation functionality.


Should be able to compare two sets of results effectively.


Guidelines for Implementation:


Ensure all components are modular, hierarchical, and interface-driven.


CFD, particle trajectories, and model outputs must follow consistent interface conventions.


Focus on clean architecture; separation of concerns is essential.



If you want, I can also convert this into a concise instruction set your agent can use step-by-step, so it knows exactly what to implement first, second, etc., without ambiguity.
Do you want me to do that?
