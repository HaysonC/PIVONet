"""Application UI layer: DEPRECATED - Not recommended for use.

This package contains a legacy Streamlit-based web GUI that is no longer maintained.
Users should use the conversational CLI interface instead:

    pivo

The CLI provides a comprehensive, interactive interface for all PIVONet operations:
  - Simulate trajectories from velocity fields
  - Train neural ODE models
  - Generate and visualize trajectory animations
  - Run YAML-defined experiment pipelines
  - Browse history and manage checkpoints

Submodules (DEPRECATED):
  - ui.py: [Legacy] Streamlit application (not recommended)

For CLI usage, see src/cli/main.py
For programmatic API, see src/networks/ and src/cfd/
