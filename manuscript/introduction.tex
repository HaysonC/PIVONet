\section{Introduction}

The motion of particles in fluids is governed by complex interactions between the underlying flow field and stochastic perturbations arising from thermal effects or turbulence~\cite{Squires2005}. Traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods provide high-fidelity simulations but are often prohibitively expensive for real-time prediction or large-scale parameter studies. 

Whereas our data are generated from imperfect computational simulations of particle trajectories governed by fluid mechanical equations, we use this as an opportunity to explore whether latent dynamical models can capture key flow features in non-laminar regimes, including advection--diffusion, turbulence, and flow separation. The goal is to assess whether such models can efficiently predict particle trajectories in two-dimensional fluid flows. We present a computationally tractable alternative for applications where traditional CFD methods are impractical.

While our model is trained on a limited set of flow conditions, it demonstrates that latent representations can capture the key patterns present within this regime. Although we do not claim broad generalization, this provides a foundation on which broader, covariate-conditioned generalization could be built in future work.
