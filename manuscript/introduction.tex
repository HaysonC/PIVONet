\section{Introduction}

The motion of particles in fluids is governed by complex interactions between the underlying flow field and stochastic perturbations arising from thermal effects or turbulence~\cite{Squires2005}. Traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods provide high-fidelity simulations but are often prohibitively expensive for real-time prediction or large-scale parameter studies. 

Whereas our method of data collection consists of an imperfect computational simulation of particle trajectories governed by a set of flow and fluid mechanical equations, we showed that our model successfully captured flow features in non-laminar flow: advection-diffusion, turbulence, and flow separation. In turn, it is able to predict particle trajectories in two-dimensional fluid flows efficiently, reflecting its viability in modeling real-world systems such as combustion engines and atmospheric circulations. 

While our model is trained on a limited set of flow conditions, it demonstrates that latent representations can capture the key patterns present within this regime. Although we do not claim broad generalization, this provides a foundation on which broader, covariate-conditioned generalization could be built in future work.
