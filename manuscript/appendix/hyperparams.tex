\section{Hyperparameter Summary} \label{apx:hyperparams}
Table~\ref{tab:hyperparams} collects the representative hyperparameters for each flow case we evaluate. Each row highlights the configuration used for the trajectory sampling, CNF backbone training, VSDE controller fitting, and inference diagnostics for that flow.

The hyperparameters were selected based on preliminary tuning to balance training stability and inference accuracy across the different flow regimes. The CNF and VSDE settings reflect the complexity of the underlying dynamics, with more challenging flows requiring larger batch sizes, longer training epochs, and finer integration steps to capture the relevant features. The inference configurations ensure sufficient ensemble diversity to evaluate model performance effectively.
